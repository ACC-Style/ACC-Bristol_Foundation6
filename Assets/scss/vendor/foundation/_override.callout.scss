/**
* Callout:
* `.callout` - a small part of content that is called out on the page. This type of treatment is great for asides, extra info or alerts. 
* 
*   @example
*	<div class="callout">
*       <h5>This call out is used for showing content on the page that should not be missed.</h5>
*	</div>
*/
/**
* Callout [States]:
* `.callouts + .warning` - Callouts are built to be effected by states so they can reflect there message as Info, Warning, Error for example. 
* 
*   @example
*	<div class="callout warning">
*        <h5>I am a call out that shows a warning about something in this section.</h5>
*	</div>
*/
/**
* Callout with close bar:
* `.callouts & .close-bar` - most callouts are openned and closed by other inputs or section triggers but there are times when a callout should be dismissed.   In these cases adding the `.closebar` DOM is most useful.  
* 
*   @example
*	<div class="callout warning">
*       <a class="close-bar">
*           <span class="close-button"><i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
*       </a>
*       <h5>I am a call out that is a warnning but can be dismissed.</h5>
*	</div>

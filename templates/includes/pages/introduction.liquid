	<h1>The ACC's Digital Framework
	<blockquote>Code Name: Bristol</blockquote>
	</h1>
	<p>The American College of Cardiology is proud of its standards of excellence when it comes to the information it supplies to the best cardiologists in the world. And now it is taking great pains to bring that exceptional standards to its UI design.</p>
	<p><strong>Bristol</strong> is the first major release for UI &amp; Design Standards by the college. The project was spearheaded by a cross division team governed by the Design Standards and Branding Commitee which was made up by team members from Digital Stradegy, Marketing &amp; Branding, and IT.</p>
	<p>The newest design from IT team is code named Bristol and ink.  The design is intended to be clean, open and focused on making data entry as smooth as possible.  Subtle textures and single lines mimic the feel of a pad of paper and a ball point pen.  The design consists of clean usage of a  single "ink" and shades of grey.  The other "action" colors are used to imply intent or application responses.  Simple modifications of the primary ink color allows recognition and product branding.  </p>
	<h3>Welcome to the framework and branding designs for the ACC.</h3>

  <p>This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are preset with a font size, line height and spacing to match the overall vertical rhythm. To show what a paragraph looks like this needs a little more content -- so, did you know that there are storms occurring on Jupiter that are larger than the Earth? Pretty cool. Wrap <code>strong</code> around type to <strong>make it bold!</strong> You can also use <code>em</code> to <em>italicize your words</em>.</p>
